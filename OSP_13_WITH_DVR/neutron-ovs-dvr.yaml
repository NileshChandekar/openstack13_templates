  # DVR requires that the L2 population feature is enabled

  NeutronEnableL2Pop: 'True'

  # Setting NeutronEnableDVR enables distributed routing support in the
  # ML2 plugin and agents that support this feature

  # We also need to set the proper agent mode for the L3 agent.  This will only
  # affect the agent on the controller node.

  # L3 HA isn't supported for DVR enabled routers. If upgrading from a system
  # where L3 HA is enabled and has neutron routers configured, it is
  # recommended setting this value to true until such time all routers can be
  # migrated to DVR routers. Once migration of the routers is complete,
  # NeutronL3HA can be returned to false. All new systems should be deployed
  # with NeutronL3HA set to false.
